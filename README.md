# How Long Should I Clap?

This is a single purpose website which aims to answer that question, assuming
you think you should clap a single time for each person in the UK killed by
COVID-19.

It assumes that each clap will take 0.5 seconds, and then uses data on deaths
in the UK published by Public Health England to work out how long you should
clap. It is automatically updated every 12 hours, although PHE publish data
less frequently.
